# TrafficReductionRemover
Disables the restriction that reduces how much traffic spawns the bigger the city gets. This may not work if the game is not relaunched between loading different savefiles.

Thanks to algernon for the help, and Captain-Of-Coit for the [template](https://github.com/Captain-Of-Coit/cities-skylines-2-mod-template)
