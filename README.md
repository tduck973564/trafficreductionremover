# TrafficReductionRemover

[Thunderstore mod link](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/tduck973564/TrafficReductionRemover/)

Disables the restriction that reduces how much traffic spawns the bigger the city gets. This may not work if the game is not relaunched between loading different savefiles, and a performance hit is to be expected.
An adjustment option is in the works.

Thanks to algernon for the help, mxdanger for the idea, and Captain-Of-Coit for the [template](https://github.com/Captain-Of-Coit/cities-skylines-2-mod-template)

Forum post about the mechanic is here: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/unlock-developer-restrictions-on-traffic-flow.1608201/

Contact me on Discord (`fesdonomist`) for any queries.

## Demonstration

Thanks to mxdanger for testing the mod and providing these graphs from his city.
The graphs below use the watch for the ResidentPurposeCounterSystem. The graph starts to increase at around 6AM, peaking at 8AM and tapering off at noon.

Here's a video of what traffic looks like in his city:
